General Project Notes:
// The course class file should be on the top level. 
// Also, the linked groupings class file should also be top level.

Extraction Code Notes:
// If we want to include the extraction code into the project, then we will need convert the code to C#
	// I think it would be good to convert to c#. I (Toby) will try to do that within the next week or so).
// Web scraper code goes in here
// Linked course extraction needs to get started
// There is a bug with how the time is recorded. 6:30 PM is being recorded as 630 rather than 1830. 

Sorter Code:
// This code will go into a separate folder. 
// For Toby and Aditi: No need for header files. As long as the class is included in the same namespace, they'll be included. 
// The Sorter Code will have it's own readme.md
