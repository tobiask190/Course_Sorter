Note:

ScrollView(Rect())

Rect(x, y, width, height) - Determines the location of the scroll. Determines the size of the window

{

	ContentSize = new Size(width, height);
	ContentOffset = new Point(x, y);
	// And the scrollbar indicators

}

ContentSize - Gives the "full size" of the entire scroll bar 
ContentOffset - Not sure what it does for the y-component, but it shifts the content
	left or right to the top left of the Rect(). The content is cut off if it is offset
	beyond the bounds of the Rect().
