---HUGE NOTE---

It's impossible to create the correct indentations and newlines because
	<>
	<>
	</>
Can just as easily be 
	<>
	  <>
	</>

There's no way to tell when to indent...
---------------

Code Readability is an intemediatary step that won't actually be included in the final product but as a developed research tool to make the code more readable.

When looking at the html source code, either the coders forgot to place newlines or the website removed the newlines. Either way, the table that contains all the courses
is stuffed onto a line making it nigh unreadable.

To help with readability of that line of relevant code, the code will take that extremely long string as a filestream and output it into another file with newlines and tabs added.

In keeping things simple for research, I'll be manually removing the specific line of code and placing it into a text file like this one. 

---Notes and brainstorm---
Some <> </> pairings are nested! That means a recursive function is required.

Some <> are not followed by a </> and are instead standalone! That means that the newline rules and tab rules don't apply to this type. 

The program won't know that after several <>'s if there will be corresponding </>'s or not!
	- In other words, when the first </> pops up, the program can't tell if the </> belongs to the first element or the last!

We can solve this problem by having TWO pointers, one at the beginning index and the other at the last index!
	- Err... on second thought, what happens if the first pointer encounters a </> before the other one?
